       <p>
         I'm an independent blockchain security researcher trying to help secure the industry, mostly working on EVM blockchains and smart contracts
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, I've worked as an aerospace engineer and then as a software engineer until I got lost into the rabbit hole
     </p>
     <p>
      Other fields of personal interest include financial engineering, system simulation and design optimisation
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy to <a href="../connect">connect</a> with other researchers and developers and have a chat!
